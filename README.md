#Server-Side APIs - Openweather One Call API
The goal of this application was to show how server-side apis may be used to get data held on external servers. The developed application works by enabling users to access the Openweather One Call API to get weather information for searched cities. The information is then retrieved, showing the weather, wind, temperature, humidity, and UV Index. After then, the data is kept locally. Additional features include the ability to delete the search history and display a 5-day forecast. Unfortunately, even though the application started to function somewhat, I ran out of time. I do plan to fully submit the application this weekend.

#User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

#Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
